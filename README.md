# 👋 Hi, I'm Wilian

I'm a backend developer passionate about building open-source tools, financial data platforms, and modular systems.  
Most of my work is focused on the **OpenFinanceData Ecosystem**, a suite of projects designed to unify, organize, and make financial data more accessible.

## OpenFinanceData Ecosystem

The **OpenFinanceData Ecosystem** is a collection of open-source tools designed to make financial data easier to access, organize, and work with across different applications.

It provides unified data endpoints, calculated indicators, a shared library, and a front-end interface for visualization — forming a modular system that can be expanded or consumed independently.

  ### 🔹 **OpenFinanceData**
  Unified financial data API providing structured endpoints for:
  - Price information  
  - Fundamentals  
  - Earnings  
  - Historical data  
  - Search & metadata  
  
  ### 🔹 **Indicators API**
  Service that exposes calculated financial indicators:
  - Valuation metrics  
  - Dividend metrics  
  - Profitability and margin indicators  
  - Growth metrics  
  - Designed for easy front-end consumption  
  
  ### 🔹 **OpenFinanceDataLib**
  Java library for collecting financial market data:
  - RAW access to Yahoo Finance data
  - Direct integration into backend projects
  - No imposed semantics or data normalization
  
  ### 🔹 **OpenFinanceData Front-End**
  A visualization interface that consumes data from the ecosystem, providing:
  - Interactive charts  
  - Financial indicators  
  - Filters and structured insights

## Experiments & Side Projects

I enjoy creating small experiments and testing random ideas — from data handling to automation, trying API concepts, building tiny tools, or playing with **React** just to see how things behave.

These are usually small tests, prototypes, or quick ideas that help me explore different ways of solving problems or understanding how something works. Sometimes they become full projects; sometimes they remain experiments — and I'm fine with both.
