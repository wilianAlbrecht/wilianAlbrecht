# 👋 Hi, I'm Wilian

I'm a backend developer passionate about building open-source tools, financial data platforms, and modular systems.  
Most of my work is focused on the **OpenFinanceData Ecosystem**, a suite of projects designed to unify, organize, and make financial data more accessible.

## OpenFinanceData Ecosystem

A collection of open-source projects built to provide structured, unified, and developer-friendly access to financial data.

## Experiments & Side Projects

I enjoy creating small experiments and testing random ideas — from data handling to automation, trying API concepts, building tiny tools, or playing with **React** just to see how things behave.

These are usually small tests, prototypes, or quick ideas that help me explore different ways of solving problems or understanding how something works. Sometimes they become full projects; sometimes they remain experiments — and I'm fine with both.
